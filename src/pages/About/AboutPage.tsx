				<Subsection title="1. Handled reports">
					<p>Tracked channels:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<DiscordLink incorrect-submissions />
						</li>
						<li>
							<DiscordLink report-a-user />
						</li>
						<li>
							<DiscordLink warning-log /> before June 14 2024 (back then it
							served both as warning log and user report)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Any message with one of these reactions ✅/❌/🔒/🗑️ is considered a
						report.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each VIP earns 1 point for each report they handle. If multiple VIPs
						work on the same report (e.g. one reacts ✅, another reacts 🔒),
						everyone involved earns 1 point.
					</p>
					<p>
						⚠️/🔨, although also commonly used to handle reports, aren't counted
						to avoid double-counting warnings and bans.
					</p>
				</Subsection>

				<Subsection title="2. Warnings issued">
					<p>
						Tracked channel: <DiscordLink warning-log />
					</p>
					<p>
						Each VIP earns 1 point for each warning. Batch warnings count
						multiple times, once for each recipient.
					</p>
				</Subsection>

				<Subsection title="3. Bans">
					<p>Tracked channels:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<DiscordLink bans />
						</li>
						<li>
							<DiscordLink warning-log /> before August 11 2021 (back then it
							served all 3 purposes)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Each VIP earns 1 point for each ban/ban proposal. Batch bans count
						multiple times, once for each recipient.
					</p>
					<p>
						Any other VIP who reacts to a ban message with ✅/🔨/👍/
						<DiscordEmoji thumbsup />
						/
						<DiscordEmoji thumbup />
						/
						<DiscordEmoji ehh />
						/👎/
						<DiscordEmoji thumbdown />
						/❌ also earns 1 point, but only 1 even if it&apos;s a batch ban.
					</p>
					<p>Approved and rejected ban proposals are counted the same.</p>
					<p>
						Reacting <img src="./icon.png" width={16} alt="verified" /> to an
						auto ban announcement earns 1 point. Batch autobans count multiple
						times.
					</p>
				</Subsection>

				<Subsection title="Caveats">
					<p>
						All of these scoring methods are based on educated guesses such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							If a message has a ✅/❌/🔒/🗑️ reaction, it&apos;s probably a
							report.
						</li>
						<li>
							If a message contains 64 consecutive alphanumeric characters,
							that&apos;s probably a user ID, so it&apos;s probably a
							ban/warning based on the channel.
						</li>
						<li>
							Before the ban/warning channel split, it&apos;s good enough to
							check whether the message contains the word &quot;ban&quot; or
							&quot;warn&quot;.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						These are reasonable assumptions for a fun project, but don&apos;t
						take the data too seriously.{" "}
						<span className={cx("tangent")}>
							(The payout multiplier is definitely real though.)
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are curious, the entire scoring logic is in{" "}
						<a href="https://github.com/FelixFourcolor/vip-leaderboard/blob/main/loader/scoring.ts">
							/loader/scoring.ts
						</a>
						.

			</Section>

			<Section title="FAQs">
				<Subsection
					title={
						<>
							Why not include other channels such as <DiscordLink genderall />,{" "}
							<DiscordLink questions />, <DiscordLink de-arrow />?
						</>
					}
				>
					<p>
						Mostly for efficiency. These channels are more general-purpose than{" "}
						<DiscordLink incorrect-submissions /> and{" "}
						<DiscordLink report-a-user />. It&apos;s not worth scraping a huge
						amount of data for relatively few points.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, outside the designated channels, the reactions ✅/❌/🔒/🗑️ are
						more likely to be used for other purposes, so those few points are
						also less accurate. It&apos;s just not worth it.
					</p>
				</Subsection>

				<Subsection title="How did you decide these scoring methods?">
					<p>
						I want to approximate the amount of effort each action takes, with 1
						unit of work = 1 point. For example, it takes the same effort to
						propose a ban whether it&apos;s approved or not, that&apos;s why
						approved and rejected bans are counted the same.
					</p>
				</Subsection>

				<Subsection title="Why only count the last 2 years?">
					<p>
						Mostly to make it more exicting to check back every month, as
						rankings are more likely to change with a rolling window. I think 2
						years is a good balance that acknowledges both old and new VIPs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, <DiscordLink report-a-user /> was separated from{" "}
						<DiscordLink warning-log /> in June 2024, coincidentally about 2
						years before the start of this project. So it&apos;s a good cutoff
						to have more reliable data.
					</p>
					<p>
						You will always have the option to see the full data, but the
						canonical ranking is based on the last 2 years (because I say so
						😎).
					</p>
				</Subsection>

				<Subsection title="Can I opt out?">
					<p>
						Of course, just let me know. Your entry will be removed from the
						leaderboard, and your stats subtracted from the total count.
					</p>
				</Subsection>

				<Subsection title="Why are some non-VIPs also on the leaderboard?">
					<p>
						The actual condition is whether you have an exclusive role (i.e. can
						only be granted by an admin, e.g. Events doesn&apos;t count). Most
						non-VIPs get in by the Cool People role.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is mostly for programming convenience, this loose filter is
						easier to implement. Naturally, non-VIPs wouldn&apos;t do mod
						activities, so if they get in, it's almost always by accident, and
						their presence doesn&#39;t affect the leaderboard in any way.
						It&apos;s a harmless laziness on my part.
